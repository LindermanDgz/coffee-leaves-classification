  abstract = {Completely self-contained-and heavily illustrated-this introduction to basic concepts and methodologies for digital image processing is written at a level that truly is suitable for seniors and first-year graduate students in almost any technical discipline. The leading textbook in its field for more than twenty years, it continues its cutting-edge focus on contemporary developments in all mainstream areas of image processing-e.g., image fundamentals, image enhancement in the spatial and frequency domains, restoration, color image processing, wavelets, image compression, morphology, segmentation, image description, and the fundamentals of object recognition. It focuses on material that is fundamental and has a broad scope of application.},

abstract = {In this article we introduce a robusta coffee leaf images dataset called RoCoLe. The dataset contains 1560 leaf images with visible red mites and spots (denoting coffee leaf rust presence) for infection cases and images without such structures for healthy cases. In addition, the data set includes annotations regarding objects (leaves), state (healthy and unhealthy) and the severity of disease (leaf area with spots). Images were all obtained in real-world conditions in the same coffee plants field using a smartphone camera. RoCoLe data set facilitates the evaluation of the performance of machine learning algorithms used in image segmentation and classification problems related to plant diseases recognition. The current dataset is freely and publicly available at https://doi.org/10.17632/c5yvn32dzg.2.}
